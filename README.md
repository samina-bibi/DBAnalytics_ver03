# DBAnalytics_ver03
This project will create a Java program that can compare two storage systems: SQLite databases and the use of Java FileOutputStreams. 

Each of these storage systems should be able to:
  Create a blank storage system for input data to be stored into.
  Be able to take some input file and put it into the storage system created in the first step.
    At the same time, it should take the write times of this process.
  Be able to clean up data when the storage system is no longer in use.
